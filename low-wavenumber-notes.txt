Constraining the wavenumbers in a neural network to accelerate convergence, especially when the solution predominantly involves low wavenumbers, can be achieved through several strategies. Here are some approaches tailored to your scenario:
1. Input Preprocessing

    Fourier Transform Filtering: If your data is spatial or temporal, apply a Fourier transform to isolate low-wavenumber components and filter out high-frequency noise. Feed only the low-frequency features to the neural network.
    Scaled Input Coordinates: Scale down the input spatial/temporal domain so the solution inherently emphasizes low-wavenumber behavior.

2. Network Architecture Design

    Frequency-Based Activation Functions:
        Use sinusoidal activation functions (e.g., sine in Siren networks) with tunable frequencies to emphasize low-frequency representations.
        Initialize weights of such functions to smaller values to bias the network towards low-frequency solutions.
    Fourier Neural Operators:
        Use architectures like Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) that inherently work in the frequency domain. These allow you to explicitly constrain the network to operate on lower wavenumbers by truncating high-frequency Fourier modes.

3. Loss Function Modification

    Spectral Penalty:
        Include a term in the loss function that penalizes high wavenumbers. For example:
        L=Base Loss+λ∫∣∇2u^(k)∣2dk
        L=Base Loss+λ∫∣∇2u^(k)∣2dk where u^(k)u^(k) is the Fourier transform of the predicted solution, and λλ controls the penalty strength.

    Targeted Spectral Norm Loss:
        Explicitly constrain the power spectrum of the solution to have energy concentrated in the low-wavenumber range.

4. Regularization Techniques

    Smoothness Constraints:
        Add regularization terms like ∥∇2u∥2∥∇2u∥2 to enforce smooth solutions, which indirectly biases the network toward low-wavenumber representations.

    Low-Pass Filtering During Training:
        Apply a low-pass filter to the output during each training epoch to suppress high-wavenumber components dynamically.

5. Initialization Strategy

    Low-Frequency Weight Initialization:
        Initialize weights to emphasize low-frequency modes. For instance, in networks with sinusoidal activations, use low-amplitude weights.

    Pretraining on a Coarse Grid:
        Pretrain the network on coarsened versions of the data, which naturally exhibit lower wavenumbers, before fine-tuning on the original data.

6. Domain Knowledge Incorporation

    Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs):
        For problems governed by PDEs, incorporate the governing equations into the loss function to bias the solution toward physically plausible, low-wavenumber behaviors.
    Analytic Basis Functions:
        Combine the NN with a predefined basis expansion (e.g., Fourier or Chebyshev) that is truncated to include only low-wavenumber components.

Practical Considerations

    Test different wavenumber thresholds to find the optimal balance between biasing the network toward low wavenumbers and retaining sufficient flexibility for accurate solutions.
    Combine multiple strategies (e.g., spectral penalties with architectural constraints) for better results.
