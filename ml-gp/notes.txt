Proof of conditional mean:

Look at this paper by Chen, "Solving and learning nonlinear PDEs with Gaussian processes"
I should have some old code for this.

Can we solve a strong-form version of the differential eigenvalue problem with Gaussian process conditionals? 
Or can we minimize the Rayleigh's quotient among a number of test points using interpolations of the Gaussian process?
Just something to think about here..

Make sure you look up what the actual strain energy functional and stability energy for plate theory is.

Can we construct the mean and covariance of the strain energy, stability, etc. from the conditional based on observed
training points? Can we solve a buckling problem using this? Could be a fun way to solve it for this project..
