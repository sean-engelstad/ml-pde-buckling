# Machine Learning for Solving Differential Eigenvalue Problems
## Focus on Eigenvalue PDEs from Buckling of Thin-Walled Structures
## By : Sean Engelstad

Considers several different strategies for solving the eigenvalue PDEs:
1. Classical Method with finite element analysis
2. Artificial neural net approaches
3. Gaussian processes for solving PDEs

### Artificial Neural Net approches include:
1. PINN
2. Tensor NN (TODO)
3. Other strategies (TODO)
